'
' There are many ways that you can modify this BASIC game.  The CONST
' statements below these comments and the DATA statements at the end
' of this screen can be modified to change the following:
'
'    Block shapes
'    Block rotation
'    Number of different block shapes
'    Score needed to advance to next level
'    Width of the game well
'    Height of the game well
'    Songs played during game
'
' On the right side of each CONST statement, there is a comment that tells
' you what it does and how big or small you can set the value.  Above the
' DATA statements, there are comments that tell you the format of the
' information stored there.
'
' On your own, you can also add exciting sound and visual effects or make any
' other changes that your imagination can dream up.  By reading the
' Learn BASIC Now book, you'll learn the techniques that will enable you
' to fully customize this game and to create games of your own.
'
' If the game won't run after you have changed it, you can exit without
' saving your changes by pressing Alt, F, X and choosing NO.
'
' If you do want to save your changes, press Alt, F, A and enter a filename
' for saving your version of the program.  Before you save your changes,
' however, you should make sure they work by running the program and
' verifying that your changes produce the desired results.  Also, always
' be sure to keep a backup of the original program.
'
DEFINT A-Z

' Here are the BASIC CONST statements you can change.  The comments tell
' you the range that each CONST value can be changed, or any limitations.
CONST WELLWIDTH = 10        ' Width of playing field (well).   Range 5 to 13.
CONST WELLHEIGHT = 21       ' Height of playing field.  Range 4 to 21.
CONST NUMSTYLES = 7         ' Number of unique shapes.  Range 1 to 20.  Make sure you read the notes above the DATA statements at the end of the main program before you change this number!

CONST NEXTLEVEL = 300       ' Helps determine when the game advances to the next level.  (Each cleared level gives player 100 points) Range 100 to 2000.
CONST BASESCORE = 1000      ' Number of points needed to advance to first level.
CONST ROTATEDIR = 1         ' Control rotation of blocks. Can be 1 for clockwise, or 3 for counterclockwise.
' The following sound constants are used by the PLAY command to
' produce music during the game.  To change the sounds you hear, change
' these constants.  Refer to the online help for PLAY for the correct format.
' To completely remove sound from the game set the constants equal to null.
